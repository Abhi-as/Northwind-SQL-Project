# Northwind-SQL-Project

## Overview

This project involves SQL practice using the Northwind sample database. The goal is to enhance SQL skills through queries with varying levels of complexity, with a database schema and practice questions provided by [SQL Practice](https://www.sql-practice.com/). The project includes three main components:

1. **SQL Queries PDF**: `Northwind Queries.pdf` contains questions, SQL queries, and results.

2. **SQL File**: `Northwind Queries.sql` contains practice questions categorized by difficulty (easy, medium, hard).

3. **Schema Information**: The schema describes how the tables (`categories`, `customers`, `employees`, `employee_territories`, `order_details`, `orders`' `products`, `regions`, `shippers`, `suppliers`, `territories`) are connected.
